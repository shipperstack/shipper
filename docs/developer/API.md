# API

This page documents the API endpoints exposed by shipper.

## Latest endpoints

### Warning!

The latest API schema is obviously not stable and can change at any time. Please proceed with caution when using these API endpoints, and keep in mind that they may change in functionality/usage and/or may disappear in the future.

If you designed something around the latest endpoint (such as `https://host/api/latest/download/build/counter/`), in order to "production-alize" it, use the version-mapped endpoint that the latest endpoint maps to (in this case, it would be `https://host/api/v2/download/build/counter/`).

## v2 endpoints

### Statistics

 - `https://host/api/v2/download/build/counter/`

Increments the download count of a given build. This API should be called by the OTA system whenever a user downloads a build. Either the `file_name` field or the `build_id` field must be supplied via REST. The `download_type` field must also be supplied, and it can currently either be `download` or `update`.

If the user is installing the build for the first time (i.e. they are downloading the build from your app to install on their device), then the download type should be `download`. If the user is obtaining the build through an OTA app, then the download type should be `update`. The endpoint will throw a 400 if a different download type is given.

This endpoint will throw a 404 if a build with the given file name or build ID does not exist, with specific error messages for each scenario.


### shippy

Returns the shipper version installed on the server.

Allows you to upload a build object in chunks given the build file and the corresponding checksum. Multiple fields must be supplied via REST. The authentication token must be supplied in the REST header. This endpoint only accepts the initial chunk, and subsequent chunks must be sent using the endpoint below. Please refer to the shippy project for implementation details.

 - `https://host/api/v1/maintainers/device/chunked_upload/<uuid:pk>`

Allows you to upload the rest of the build object by sending subsequent chunks associated with the chunked upload ID. Multiple fields must be supplied via REST. The authentication token must be supplied in the REST header. Please refer to the shippy project for implementation details.

Returns a 200 with the enable/disable status if successful.

This endpoint will throw a 400 if one or more of the required fields are missing and a 401 if you are unauthorized to modify builds.

### Updater

This endpoint will throw a 404 if the device is not found or if there are no builds for the specified variant and a 400 if the supplied variant name is invalid.
